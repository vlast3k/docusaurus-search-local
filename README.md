Forked from [https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local]() so that some local changes can be done

This root project most likely did something in the original repo, but for now it is not clear exactly what and how

The real stuff is in the [docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/vlast3k/docusaurus-search-local/tree/master/docusaurus-search-local) folder, which contains the acutal Node JS module, and package that is published to NPM

It also contains details how to rebuild it
